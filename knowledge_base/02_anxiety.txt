Anxiety & Overthinking
Its normal to feel anxious before results or presentations.
Quick relief:
 Box breathing (4-4-4-4)
 5-4-3-2-1 grounding: name 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, etc.
 Write down the worry  close the notebook  tell yourself Ill think about it at 7 PM
You are safe right now. This feeling will pass.
