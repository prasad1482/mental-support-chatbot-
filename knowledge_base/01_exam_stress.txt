Exam Stress Management
Common signs: constant worry, headaches, loss of appetite, irritability
Techniques that work fast:
 4-7-8 breathing: inhale 4 sec, hold 7 sec, exhale 8 sec
 Pomodoro: study 25 min  5 min break
 Avoid all-nighters — sleep is the best revision tool
 Talk to a friend or teacher — youre not alone
Remember: one exam doesnt define your worth!
